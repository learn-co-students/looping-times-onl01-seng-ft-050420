#We're still struggling to master that levitation charm. Since we need to keep practicing, let's write some code that allows us to `puts` the phrase "Wingardium Leviosa" only seven times (instead of infinitely, like when we used just a plain `loop` construct).
#"#using_times" do 
	#it  out the phrase 'Wingardium Leviosa' 7 times by using the `times` construct" do
	

def using_times
	7.times do
	  puts "Wingardium Leviosa"
	end
end
